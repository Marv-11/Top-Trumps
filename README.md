# Top-Trumps
In this project I created a small game where players compare stats using Pokemon API, similar to the Top Trumps card game. The basic flow of the games is:

1. You are given a random card with different stats
2. You select one of the card's stats
3. Another random card is selected for your opponent (the computer)
4. The stats of the two cards are compared
5. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins
