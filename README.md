# Top-Trumps
In this project created a small game where players compare stats using Pokemon API, similar to the Top Trumps card game. The basic flow of the games is:

You are given a random card with different stats
You select one of the card's stats
Another random card is selected for your opponent (the computer)
The stats of the two cards are compared
The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins
